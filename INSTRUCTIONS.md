### ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS FROM UCONN'S CODING BOOTCAMP

### Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The starter code uses the Day.jsLinks to an external site. library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality.

**IMPORTANT**<br>
Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!
